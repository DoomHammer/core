---

We have the first remote meetup planned for Tuesday, December 10 in Żyrardów. The city is inhabited by around 41K people. We plan to set up initial cooperation with locals who are interested in remote work. We already plan to support follow up meetings, with the growing community.

The event is open, but there is a limited number of seats. If you are interested to participate, please reach out to [Michal Mikolajczyk](mailto:michal.mikolajczyk@toptal.com).
