On November 22, we will present the project at [JS Poland](https://js-poland.pl/) conference in front of an audience of 800+ attendees. The keynote is planned for 15 minutes, starting 1.40 pm.

The project will be presented to people already familiar with or active in the IT environment. We will try to encourage new volunteers to [contribute to the project](https://digital-inclusion.github.io/core/contribute)
